# P2PKit

A library written as part of my bachelor thesis. It provides implementations for Bonjour, Bluetooth and Multipeer Connectivity to find other devices or advertise themself. Once connected, you may send `Data` through the established connection.

> I'm not planning on maintaining this library actively, but I thought I'd at least publish it
